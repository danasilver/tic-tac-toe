Tic Tac Toe
------------

Four Java classes:
	- BoardCanvas.java
	- TTTGame.java
	- Computer.java
	- TicTacToeApplet.java
	
Each class contains extensive JavaDoc comments.

* Player MUST select opponent and player one's piece to begin.

* It is a known issue that when the human player ties the computer,
  the computer makes an additional move.  This issue should be resolved soon.
  
* TTTGame currently uses a two-dimensional array to keep track of moves.
  Computer uses a one-dimensional array to determine the computer's move.
  An update to TTTGame will use a one-dimensional array 
  instead to simplify the program.
